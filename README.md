# Ionic 2 Webpack Starter

Ionic 2 starter project using Webpack 2 and [@ngtools/webpack](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/webpack) for AoT template compilation.

Includes Sass support for [theming your app](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/theming/theming-your-app/). Styles can be encapsulated in the component, without the need for a `selector` metadata property like in projects generated with the Ionic CLI.

```typescript
@Component({
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss']
})
export class HomePage { }
```

Does not yet include integration with Cordova. You could however generate a new project using the Cordova CLI, copy the `dist` folder generated by this project into the `www` folder of the Cordova project, run it in Android or iOS and it will work fine.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
* Run `npm run build` to bundle everything into the `dist` folder for deployment.
* Run `npm run build:prod` to do the same as above but enabling optimisations for production.
