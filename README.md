# Ionic 2 Webpack Starter

Experimental Ionic 2 starter project using Webpack 2.

Currently only works for a website (no Cordova support to build a mobile app) and with the default Ionic theme (no Sass support).

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
* Run `npm run build` to bundle everything into the `dist` folder for deployment; use `npm run build:prod` for a production build.
